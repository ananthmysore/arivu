This is possible only when the children undergo activity based learning and connect themselves to environment around. As there is no school fostering above mentioned aspects, ARIVU was started in the year 2008 in an Organic Farm adjacent to Lingambudhi Bird Sanctuary. ARIVU believes that the learning means exploring and perceiving the world.

                                The aim of the education is not to mug up the data or information. Instead the aim is to enable the children to think logically and imbibe the learning. In order to make the parents and others to witness the learning of the children, we arrange three ‘Learning exhibitions’ in an academic year. Apart from this, a monthly meeting is also arranged with the parents to meet the teachers in order to keep track of student’s learning curve.

They are engaged in meaningful conversations regarding their day to day life, environment around them, thus creating the spirit of inquiry in them. Live experiments are organised whenever, wherever possible leading to numerous experiences. Questions arising out of these experiences are appropriately dealt leading to the building up of scientific attitude.

                                Education is not limited to school. Children learn a lot at home. Hence school and home need to go hand in hand. Parents participation proves very helpful for children and for school. Parents know about what is happening in school, what challenges the child is facing and the school knows about the culture at home. This proves very useful when dealing with holistic development of children.

                                While there are millions of things we can learn in life, no school can accommodate more than a small number of teachers. Resource persons help in expanding the learning horizon of children. Arivu invites resource persons from all walks of life and our student get to learn a lot of things from them. This ensure a wide exposure of learning spectrum to the child and it also doesn’t put undue pressure on the teachers to teach all the things that they might not be expert of.

For e.g. we have already finished our last theme of “Water” where students learnt about mathematics of water( measurement), science of water ( types, water cycle) and so on. At end of the term, students share their learning in form of an exhibition. It is called learning exhibition. It usually happens once in three months.
